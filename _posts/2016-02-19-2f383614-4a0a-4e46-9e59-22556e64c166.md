The Human Mind - Neuroscience, and Cognition made is easy.

What is to think, to feel, to perceive, to see, to taste what goes on inside our 'minds'.

A mind is the set of cognitive faculties that enables consciousness, 
perception, thinking, judgement, and memory---a characteristic which makes
us uniquely human.

Neuroscience studies the nervous system, the physical basis of the mind. At the systems level, neuroscientists investigate how biological neural networks form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory.
